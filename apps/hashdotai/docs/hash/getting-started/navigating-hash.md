# Navigating HASH {#navigating-hash}

!["The HASH interface"](https://hash.ai/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/EipKtqu98OotgfhvKf6Eew/7e719229-7e04-448a-1456-fa549cf94800/public)

The HASH interface is an all-in-one, browser-based, no-code workspace made up of three main panels:

1.  The **top-nav**, where you’ll see the workspace switcher and options to create new Pages, Entity Types, and Entities.
1.  The **left side-bar**, where you’ll find your account options alongside panels for managing Pages and Types.
1.  The **center pane**, where Types, Entities, Pages, and Blocks are viewed and manipulated.
